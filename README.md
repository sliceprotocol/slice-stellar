# ⚖️ Slice Protocol Application

This project is the frontend implementation for **Slice**, a **neutral, on-chain dispute resolution protocol** built on Next.js. It features a **multi-tenant architecture** capable of running as a standalone PWA or as an embedded MiniApp across various wallet ecosystems (Base, Beexo).

**🔗 Live Demo**: [Testnet](https://dev.slicehub.xyz) | [Mainnet](https://app.slicehub.xyz)

## What is Slice?

**Slice** is a **decentralized dispute resolution protocol** for smart contracts and dApps. It acts as a **neutral truth oracle** that resolves disputes through **randomly selected jurors**, **private voting**, and **on-chain verification**.

Slice ensures a trustless, verifiable, and economically secure ruling (Party A or Party B) that external protocols can rely on and execute.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Multi-Tenant & Strategy Pattern

This application uses a **Strategy Pattern** to manage wallet connections and SDK interactions. Instead of a single monolithic connection logic, we use an abstraction layer that selects the appropriate **Adapter** based on the runtime environment (detected via subdomains and SDK presence).

### 1. Connection Strategies

We support two active connection strategies (with Lemon planned):

| Strategy              | Description                                           | Used By           |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Wagmi SW**          | Uses Smart Wallets (Coinbase/Safe) via Privy & Wagmi. | **PWA**, **Base** |
| **Wagmi EOA**         | Uses standard Injected (EOA) connectors.              | **Beexo**         |
| *(Planned)* Lemon SDK | Native `@lemoncash/mini-app-sdk`.                     | Lemon             |

---

### 2. Supported MiniApps & Environments

The application behaves differently depending on the access point (Subdomain) and injected providers.

| Platform            | Subdomain | Connection Strategy | Auth Type                 |
| :------------------ | :-------- | :------------------ | :------------------------ |
| **Standard PWA**    | `app.`    | **Wagmi SW**        | Social / Email / Wallet   |
| **Base MiniApp**    | `base.`   | **Wagmi SW**        | Coinbase Smart Wallet     |
| **Beexo**           | `beexo.`  | **Wagmi EOA**       | Injected Provider (Beexo) |
| **Lemon (planned)** | `lemon.`  | Lemon SDK           | Native Lemon Auth         |

## How Slice Works

1. **Create Dispute**: External contract calls `createDispute(...)` with the dispute details.
2. **Juror Selection**: Slice randomly selects jurors from a staked pool using **verifiable randomness (VRF)**.
3. **Private Voting**: Jurors commit votes privately using a hash (`hash(vote_option + secret)`).
4. **Reveal & Verification**: Jurors reveal their vote and secret to verify their commitment. Only revealed votes are counted.
5. **Final Ruling**: Slice aggregates votes and publishes the result on-chain.
6. **Execution**: External protocols execute based on the ruling.

---

## Integration Guide (For Developers)

Integrating Slice into your protocol is as simple as 1-2-3:

1. **Create a Dispute**
   Call `slice.createDispute(defender, category, ipfsHash, jurorsRequired)` from your contract.

2. **Wait for Ruling**
   Slice handles the juror selection, voting, and consensus off-chain and on-chain.

3. **Read the Verdict**
   Once the dispute status is `Executed`, read the `winner` address from the `disputes` mapping and execute your logic.

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure Environment

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your keys.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV="development" # or 'production'

# Pinata / IPFS Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT="your_pinata_jwt"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY_URL="your_gateway_url"

# Privy Config (For PWA / Base)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="your_privy_app_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID="your_privy_client_id"

# Contracts
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SLICE_CONTRACT="0x..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_USDC_CONTRACT="0x..."
```

---

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

* **PWA Mode:** `http://localhost:3000`
* **MiniApp Mode:** Use the native testing environment provided by the wallet SDK.

---

## ⚙️ Application Configuration

The `src/config/` and `src/adapters/` directories manage the multi-environment logic.

### Abstraction Layer (`src/adapters/`)

We abstract wallet interactions behind a common interface:

* **`useWalletAdapter`** – Selects the active strategy based on environment.
* **`WagmiAdapter`** – Wraps Wagmi hooks (Smart Wallets or EOA).
* *(Planned)* **`LemonAdapter`** – Will wrap `@lemoncash/mini-app-sdk`.

### Chain Configuration (`src/config/chains.ts`)

* Exports `SUPPORTED_CHAINS` mapping Wagmi `Chain` objects to contract addresses.
* Defaults based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`.

---

## Smart Contract Development

The `contracts/` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts using **Hardhat** and **Viem**.

### Commands

```bash
pnpm hardhat compile
pnpm hardhat test
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia
```
